# Release Notes

## About

The goal of the _Release Notes_ project is to work out an **easy to use**,
**human readable** and **machine processable** schema for release notes.

Currently most of the open source projects out there do not provide
details of what was added or what has changed when they release a new
version.

## Why should I care about release notes?

Because this is an easy way for other people to keep track on what has
changed in your software.
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) is a great commitment on
building compatible components in a distributed open source world.
**BUT** it will not tell your dependents whether they have to urgently
upgrade to the next compatible version, eg. in case of an security fix.
